Machine-Learning-Model-for-Weather-Forecasting


Purpose of this project is to predict the temperature using different algorithms like Logistic regression,RandomForest Classifier, SUPPORT VECTOR CLASSIFIER, KNeighborsClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier. The output value should be numerically based on multiple extra factors like maximum temperature, minimum temperature, cloud cover, humidity, and sun hours in a day, precipitation, pressure and wind speed.
